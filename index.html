melo-type is a text-based melodic step sequencer.
📄➡🎼.

When you type any character from the above grid into this text area, melo-type will play a musical note. Give it a try!

All whitespace, capital letters and 'upper' characters (e.g. ~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:&quot;&lt;>?) will be ignored.

Once you've written a sequence of notes that you like, hit the play button to hear them in a loop.

You can also hit the 'Demo' button to load up an example tune.

If you want melo-type to rest for a beat anywhere in the sequence, just type backslash '\'.

The note value of each character is based on its position in the keyboard.

Notes get higher as you move upward/to the right, and lower as you move downward/to the left.

To use a bit of musical terminology:

  ➡️ +1 semitone
  ⬅️ -1 semitone
  ⬆️ +3 semitones
  ⬇️ -3 semitones

The lowest note is middle C (~261hz) at the 'z' key. The highest note is G#5 (~830hz) at the '=' key.

But don't worry if that doesn't make sense, just play around!

To set the playback speed of the loop, type your desired bpm (beats per minute) inside backticks '`' anywhere in the sequence (only the last bpm value will be observed).

e.g. `234` blah blah blah

The default bpm is 480.

Enjoy!
