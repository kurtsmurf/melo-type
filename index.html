melo-type is a text-based melodic step sequencer 📄➡🎼.

When you type any character from the above grid into this text area, you will hear a musical note. Give it a try!

The note value of each key is based on its position in the keyboard.

Notes get higher as you move upward/to the right, and lower as you move downward/to the left.

To use a bit of musical terminology:

  ➡️ +1 semitone
  ⬅️ -1 semitone
  ⬆️ +3 semitones
  ⬇️ -3 semitones

...but don't worry if that doesn't make sense, just play around!

Once you've written a sequence of notes that you like, hit the play button to hear them in a loop.

If you want melo-type to rest for a beat anywhere in the sequence, just type backslash '\'.

To set the playback speed of the loop, type your desired bpm (beats per minute) inside backticks '`' anywhere in the sequence (only the last bpm value will be observed).

e.g. `234` blah blah blah

Enjoy!
